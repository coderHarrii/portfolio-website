                avaiable on the internet, so that we can observe how the three basic human rights
                were distribuited at state and national level.

                At the same time, a questionnaire was developed to analyze the

                In Brazil there is a large area of ​​isolation in places
                rural areas because they are far from urbanization, and with the lack of
                transport many families and small entrepreneurs
                end up being isolated from the population itself, having
                difficulties in moving to the urban center and
                great difficulty in receiving food and medical assistance.
                In several cases, the residents of the region suffer from the
                lack of medical and school resources, losing the right
                of citizen.<br><br>
                In the IFSP-SJC campus, students have
                encountered difficulty with transport. for being a place
                where few people attend and for being in a
                Highway, public transport is restricted, where you have
                only one bus line, which ends up having a difficult
                access for people who come from all corners of the
                City. The only bus line that you have only goes through the
                center and few students manage to get it. This type
                problem affects the lives of many students, making
                with that many have to take at least two buses
                to go to school and causing physical and
                psychological.

                In the country there are great inequalities regarding the area of
                education, as in neighborhoods far from the centers, and
                of urban and rural regions. An INEP study found
                that, in the age group of 10 to 14 years, 95% of young people in
                rural area, and 97% of young people in urban areas are located
                at Schools. The study also points out that 50% of
                urban children who attend schools
                are lagging behind in school. In rural areas, this
                situation affects 72% of students, thus revealing to have a
                discriminating delay, requiring the implementation
                of teaching programs capable of showing the actions
                of the state, taking into account the 1988 constitution. Or
                that is, the right to education is not only distant in the regions
                underprivileged as well as across the entirety of the
                National territory.<br><br>
                There are also regional inequalities in sanitation
                basic, whose importance is linked to systems that take care of
                water supply, sewage treatment
                and control of the destination of the garbage produced by the population,
                in order to promote hygienic and healthy habits,
                improvement of public cleaning and thus taking quality of
                life to the population. It is observed that the southeastern region of the country
                has better access to basic sanitation than the
                north and northeast regions

                With the data obtained in the research, it is observed that the region
                Southeast presents better conditions of access to
                basic sanitation, education and transport. There is still
                considerable differences between urban and rural regions, and
                central and peripheral neighborhoods in urban areas.
